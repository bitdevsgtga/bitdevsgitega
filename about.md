**BitDevs Gitage** is a community of Bitcoin developers, educators, builders, and technically curious enthusiasts based in Gitage. Inspired by the original BitDevs NYC, we explore the inner workings of Bitcoin through meetups, workshops, study groups, and Socratic Seminars. Our focus includes Bitcoin protocol development, the Lightning Network, privacy tools, and practical local use cases.

We also share developer-focused opportunities such as grants, bounties, fellowships, and job openings in the Bitcoin ecosystem to help grow local talent and connect Gitagen developers with the global open-source Bitcoin movement.

We welcome developers, builders, educators, entrepreneurs, students, and anyone curious about how Bitcoin works under the hood and how it can be applied to solve real challenges in Gitage.

### What We Do

- **Bootcamps**: A structured program combining education, collaboration, and practical building to grow Bitcoin technical skills in Gitage.
- **Technical Discussion Meetups**: Regular Socratic Seminars covering the latest Bitcoin technology, research, BIPs, and implementation updates.
- **Workshops & Hackathons**: Hands-on sessions for developers and technologists to build local Bitcoin solutions.
- **Reading Groups**: Deep dives into Bitcoin technical literature.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Support for open-source Bitcoin development in the Gitagen context.

### Socratic Seminars

Our seminars are structured to encourage deep discussion and learning around Bitcoinâ€™s protocol, development tools, privacy improvements, and emerging ideas in the ecosystem. Each session features curated topics drawn from BitDevs mailing lists, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), GitHub PRs, research papers, and open-source development updates.

Participants are encouraged to read in advance and come with questions or ideas to share. These events are not recorded â€” they are meant to be informal, candid, and engaging.

Some sessions include lightning talks, hands-on demos, or breakout discussions. We also create a safe space for beginners to ask questions and learn alongside more experienced contributors.
