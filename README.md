# BitDevs-Zambia
BitDevs Zambia is a Bitcoin Zambia initiative to foster Bitcoin development, education, and open-source collaboration in Zambia. Inspired by global BitDevs communities, this project provides a local space for developers, researchers, and Bitcoin enthusiasts to study and contribute to Bitcoin's protocol and ecosystem.

The initiative officially launched during the first BitDev workshop in Lusaka (April 2025), hosted by Bitcoin Zambia and Anita Posch, and supported by Bitcoin for Fairness.

- Host regular BitDevs-style Socratic Seminars and Bitcoin Reading Groups
- Support local developers learning to build with and contribute to Bitcoin
- Curate resources, discussion notes, and learning materials relevant to the Zambian context
- Promote free and open-source contributions to Bitcoin and related technologies
