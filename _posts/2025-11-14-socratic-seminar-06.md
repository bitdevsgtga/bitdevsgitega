## Summary:
The 6th Socratic Seminar of BitDevs Gitega was held successfully, maintaining the community’s usual energy and technical depth, even though heavy rain limited attendance to 15 participants. Despite the weather, the discussions remained highly interactive and insightful.
FThe session was led by Advaxe NDAYISENGA, Ndikumana Idris, and Barakana Guy-Eudes, each contributing on key technical topics relevant to Lightning development and upcoming opportunities:

●	Advaxe delivered a detailed presentation on integrating Lightning APIs, with a focus on Blink and Bitnob. He demonstrated how to handle authentication, manage API endpoints, use webhooks, and send/receive Lightning payments programmatically.

●	Idris addressed the common issues and errors developers face when integrating Lightning APIs. He discussed timeout errors, authentication failures, misconfigured Lightning nodes, rate limits, and provided practical debugging tips.

●	Barakana shared information about upcoming opportunities for developers, including the 2026 Bootcamps and technical programs offered by Btrust to strengthen local and African open-source Bitcoin development.

As with the September and October sessions, the seminar emphasized collaborative learning, hands-on technical exploration, and the progressive growth of the BitDevs Gitega ecosystem. The community is steadily gaining confidence in both on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin technologies.
