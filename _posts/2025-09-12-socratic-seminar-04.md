## Summary:
The 4th Socratic Seminar of BitDevs Gitega was an emotionally moving and highly engaging session. It served as the best moment for the FOSS developer subgroups to present the progress of their respective projects.

As of this session:

●	All members and participants now have a solid understanding of how on-chain Bitcoin transactions work.

●	Most teams have already completed the front-end development of their applications.

●	The focus has now shifted to back-end integration, with teams actively building the core functionalities of their tools.

This seminar also featured a special technical session introducing participants to the Lightning Network, opening new perspectives on instant Bitcoin payments and scalability.


The session was led by <a href="https://x.com/AdvaxeIr" target="_blank">Advaxe NDAYISENGA</a>, who delivered a comprehensive introduction to:

●	The fundamentals of the Lightning Network,

●	How to set up and operate a Lightning node,

●	How to access and implement Lightning APIs in their FOSS projects.

This was a crucial turning point for developers to begin exploring off-chain Bitcoin transactions, expanding the scope and use cases of their solutions.
