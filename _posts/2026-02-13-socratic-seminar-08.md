## Summary:
The 8th Socratic Seminar of BitDevs Gitega focused on the practical demonstration of integrating the Cashu protocol into locally developed solutions. Following the January session where participants were introduced to the fundamentals of Cashu and the approval of BTC Shule’s local mint, February marked an important step toward real-world implementation. The session was centered on a live technical demo showing how Cashu can be embedded into local tools to facilitate transactions despite poor and unstable internet connectivity, a common challenge across many parts of Burundi.

During the session, participants explored:
●	The practical process of issuing and redeeming ecash tokens through the local mint

●	How peer-to-peer transfers can function efficiently under low-bandwidth conditions

●	Integration logic of Cashu into locally built applications

●	Design considerations for enabling resilient local transactions


The demo included transaction simulations reflecting Burundi’s connectivity constraints. Developers were able to observe how lightweight, privacy-preserving digital cash can operate in environments where constant internet access is not guaranteed.

The topic generated strong engagement, particularly around how such integrations could strengthen local circular economies and support community-level payments. Discussions became increasingly technical, with participants analyzing architecture choices, UX design under infrastructure limitations, and security considerations.

The seminar maintained its collaborative structure, with active technical exchanges and concrete ideas proposed for experimentation within ongoing BitDevs Gitega projects.

## Key Takeaways and challenges:
★	The seminar transitioned from theoretical understanding to practical demonstration.

★	Developers gained hands-on insight into integrating Cashu into local applications.

★	Participants clearly recognized the importance of offline-capable and low-connectivity payment systems in the Burundian context.

★	The local Cashu mint is becoming a functional experimentation tool rather than only a conceptual project.

★	Technical maturity within the group continues to grow, with stronger focus on real-world deployment challenges.

★	Engagement and collaboration among developers remain strong.







## Next Steps:
❖	Encourage developers to prototype small-scale integrations using the local Cashu mint

❖	Identify potential pilot use cases in low-connectivity environments

❖	Document implementation challenges and lessons learned

❖	Continue deepening technical discussions around privacy-preserving and resilient payment tools

❖	Prepare teams for more advanced experimentation within the FOSS ecosystem
