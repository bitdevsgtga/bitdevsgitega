## Summary:
The 7th Socratic Seminar of BitDevs Gitega marked a strong and symbolic start to the year 2026 for our developer community. Beyond the technical learning environment, this session served as a meaningful moment of reconnection, where participants took time to exchange New Year wishes and reaffirm their shared commitment to learning, building, and contributing to the Bitcoin and FOSS ecosystem.
The seminar also represented an important technical milestone for the program. A dedicated session was led by Advaxe NDAYISENGA, who introduced participants to the Cashu protocol, following the official approval of BTC Shule’’s local Cashu mint granted for community use. This represents a strategic advancement in our journey toward building practical, locally relevant financial tools.
During the session, participants explored:
●	The fundamentals of the Cashu ecash protocol

●	How a local community mint operates

●	Privacy-preserving digital cash concepts

●	Use cases of Cashu within community-based tools and applications

This topic resonated strongly with participants, especially given Burundi’s realities of intermittent internet access and infrastructure limitations. Cashu was widely recognized as a powerful tool for enabling offline and low-connectivity transactions, making it particularly suitable for real-world adoption within rural and underserved communities.
The seminar maintained its collaborative structure, with participants actively engaging in discussions, asking technical questions, and sharing ideas on how Cashu could be incorporated into future FOSS projects developed under the BitDevs Gitega program.
