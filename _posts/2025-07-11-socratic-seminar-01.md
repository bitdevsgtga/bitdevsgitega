## Summary:
The second BitDevs Gitega meetup marked a deeper dive into hands-on open-source development. The technical session was led by Advaxe NDAYISENGA, who gave a detailed walkthrough on how open-source solutions should be properly structured and published on GitHub for global collaboration and adoption. This practical session helped participants understand the importance of documentation, issue tracking, repository structure, and contribution protocols.

A key highlight of this session was the formation of collaborative development teams, following up on the initiative introduced during the June meetup. Each team received specific project assignments from Mr. Advaxe to work on in the coming weeks. These collaborative assignments are designed to ensure that every participant is actively involved in contributing to the open-source Bitcoin ecosystem.
