## Summary:
The third monthly Socratic Seminar of BitDevs Gitega was a valuable opportunity to showcase early open-source work from the development teams created during previous meetups. The four groups  : IWACUTECH , LEGENDS , UMUHORATECH , and TANGANYIKATECH  , each shared progress on their projects.
While all groups proposed initial GitHub repositories, most struggled to integrate Bitcoin libraries due to technical limitations. This highlighted the need to bring in experienced FOSS developers to offer technical assistance and mentorship.

The session also included a technical presentation by <a href="https://x.com/AdvaxeIr" target="_blank">Advaxe NDAYISENGA</a>, who walked participants through how Bitcoin transactions work  from sending to receiving including a breakdown of UTXOs, signatures, and transaction fees.

## Key Takeaways and challenges:
★	All groups proposed repositories, but few succeeded in building functional APKs

★	Major blocker: difficulty integrating Bitcoin libraries such as bitcoinj or kps in Android/Kotlin environments

★	Urgent need for technical mentors to guide the teams through FOSS development

★	Strong group collaboration and shared enthusiasm for open-source contribution


## Next Steps:
❖	Ongoing project development by each team

❖	Outreach to external FOSS mentors to join the community

❖	Setup of a shared GitHub organization for all repositories

❖	Preparation for the mini Hackathon for teams towards the end of the year
